                Protecting the personal information collected by SteemLogin is of paramount importance to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                We limit the amount of collected information to its strict minimum and store on our server only what is necessary to operate the service.<br/>
              </p>
                SteemLogin acts as an authentication gateway between approved Steem applications (the "clients") and reputable authentication providers such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and GitHub.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon first use of our service our users are asked to enter their Steem username and posting key.<br/>
                Those details are then stored within our <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">Cloud Firestore</a> database so that this information can be returned to the client upon future authentications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under no circumstances will stored Steem usernames and posting keys willingfuly be shared with third party individuals or organizations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some personal information is exchanged between SteemLogin and authentication providers during the authentication process.<br/>
                This includes email adress and authentication tokens providing limited use of service with those authentication providers.<br/>
                This information is forwarded to the clients upon successful completion of the authentication procedure.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following sections provide detailed information about how we collect and use your personal information.
              </p>

                An irreversible hash is used to uniquely identify users from their email address.<br/>
                This avoids the need for storing email addresses within the database.
              </p>
              <h2 class="content-subhead">Personal information stored within the client (e.g. browser)</h2>
