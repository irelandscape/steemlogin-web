                <h2 class="content-subhead">What is SteemLogin?</h2>
                <p>
                    SteemLogin provides a very easy way for Steem users to sign in to their favourite applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other utilities, such as <a href="https://app.steemconnect.com">SteemConnect</a>, SteemLogin allows users to authenticate themselves using mainstream authentication providers such as Google and Facebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the first authentication, users are requested to provide their Steem username and Posting Key which are then stored within a secure database and returned to the Steem application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From then on, the sign-in process simply consists in users authenticating themselves with their provider of choice - be it Google, Facebook, Twitter or GitHub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon each successful authentication with one of the above providers, the Steem username and posting key are retrieved from the SteemLogin database and passed back to the Steem application.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Users never need ever again to enter their complicated 50 character hash posting key across all supported Steem apps and devices!</strong>
                </p>


                <h2 class="content-subhead">Why use SteemLogin?</h2>
                <p>
                    A posting key looks like this:
                    <pre>5K7dsflOerj8324lfsdf0lfsKDFSL0284kF9KFWl85skdfk37ks</pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a 50 character hash which is impossible to memorize and difficult to enter without making any mistakes.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While such passwords are very awkward to type in on a PC/laptop, the task becomes even more painful when using handheld devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>In our opinion this is one of the main barriers standing in the way for wide adoption of Steem applications!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this day and age people have come to expect being able to login to most applications using mainstream content providers and social networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>This is the user experience that SteemLogin will provide to your Steem app!</strong>
                </p>

                <h2 class="content-subhead">How does it work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Upon signing in to the application the user will be redirected to the SteemLogin authentication portal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There, he/she will be presented with the following authentication options:
                </p>
                <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/fbPxWdwx/Screenshot-from-2019-03-14-20-04-06.png' border='0' alt='Authentication choices'/>
                <p>
                    The user selects his/her authentication provider of choice and completes the verification procedure that he/she is accustomed to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user should be asked by the provider to authorize SteemLogin for authentication.
                </p>
                <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/LXg46Vq2/Screenshot-2019-03-06-14-04-05.png' border='0' alt='Authorisation request'/>
                <p>
                    Upon successfully authenticating with the provider, the user is redirected to the SteemLogin application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SteemLogin retrieves all stored Steem account details (usernames and posting keys), if available, from its database and checks if these details are still valid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user is then invited to select his/her account of choice or add another Steem account into the system.
                </p>
                <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sDFCQHnL/Screenshot-from-2019-03-14-20-10-08.png" border="0" alt="Choose Steem account"/>
                <p>
                    Once a Steem account has been selected, SteemLogin redirects the user to the Steem application.<br/>
                    In the process a unique authorization code is supplied to the app which allows it to retrieves securely the account details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Steem application can now use the Steem username and posting key with the Steem blockchain for all operations requiring authentication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user is logged in.
                </p>
                <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/DZzWnshc/Screenshot-2019-03-06-14-19-46.png' border='0' alt='User is logged in'/>
                <h2 class="content-subhead">What if the user Steem details are not available or changed?</h2>
                <p>
                    Upon authentication with the external provider SteemLogin checks if a valid Steem username and posting key are stored in its database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If not, the user is presented with a form allowing him/her to type in those details.
                </p>
                <img src='https://i.postimg.cc/XYRjVNRr/Screenshot-from-2019-03-14-20-05-33.png' border='0' alt='Steem details form'/>
                <p>
                    The Steem details are automatically checked before allowing the user to submit the form and be redirected to the Steem app.
                </p>

                <h2 class="content-subhead">Is SteemLogin secure?</h2>
                <p>
                    With many wisely urging people not to share their keys with anybody it is only natural to wonder if posting keys are safely stored by SteemLogin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We take the safety of your posting key extremely seriously!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this reason we have decided <strong>not</strong> to store your Steem details on our own servers, but instead to use the services of <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a>, a Google owned company which takes extreme care in securing data on behalf of their customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SteemLogin makes use of the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">Cloud Firestore</a> database product which automatically encrypts all data on the disk and prevents logged in users from accessing database records created by other users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, all information exchanged between SteemLogin and the Steem applications is encrypted using HTTPs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SteemLogin does not store any other information about a user but the Steem username and posting key. Google/FB/Twitter/GitHub authentication tokens and other sensitive information is <strong>not</strong> stored within our database but is simply passed back to the Steem application over HTTPs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally one must remember what can be done with the posting key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The posting key allows a user to post, edit, upvote, and resteem content on the Steem blockchain. It also enables following other Steem users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The posting key <strong>does not allow</strong> one to make financial transactions (such as transfering Steems or SBDs), change personal information or other passwords.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>SteemLogin will not allow users to store accidently other more sensitive keys such as the active or owner keys!</strong>
                </p>

                <h2 class="content-subhead">Is SteemLogin opensource and who is behind the project?</h2>
                <p>
